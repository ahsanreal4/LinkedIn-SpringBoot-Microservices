**This project demonstrates following API concepts<br/>**
- Api Gateway ( Routing, Authentication, Authorization, Rate Limiting )
- Services registration and discovery, load balancing using Eureka Server
- Authentication and Authorization using JWT
- Intercommunication between Microservices
- Circuit breaker using Spring Resillience
- File upload to Cloudinary
- Database connection pooling
<br/><br/>

**Future Goals**
- Adding RabbitMQ to handle all the events of the microservices including notifications, chat events etc.
- Improve scalability with Event Driven Architecture
- Try looking into Service Mesh for better inter-communication between microservices
